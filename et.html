            <p class="etp1">The final project in theme 02 Basic Animation, was a group project. We had to choose a scene from a movie and make it into an interactive web animation in a certain style. We were also given a song we had to include somehow in the interactive web animation. </p>
            <p class="etp2">My group got film noir as our style and the song "There ain't no cure for love" by Leonard Cohen. My group chose to take a scene from E.T. The scene we took are the one where the police are chasing E.T. and the boys. My part of the group work, was to do some of the Graphics, and making questions to the expert test. I made the “evil” police car in illustrator, as well as the boys on the bicycles with Elliot and E.T.</p>
