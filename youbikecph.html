            <h1 class="youbikeh1">Promoting An Idea</h1>
            <p class="bikep">The project "promoting an idea" was a group project, where we had to make a promotional video for Copenhagen Municipality's Bicycle Program. We also had to make a one-page campaign website where our promotional video would be shown.</p>

            <p class="bikep2">My main part of this project was to be the actress in the video, but I helped out with the editing of the video as well.</p>

            <h2 class="youbikecph2">You Bike CPH</h2>
            <p class="bikep3">My group's video is about a young tourist that has just arrived in Copenhagen. She really wants to go and explore the city by biking around, but she gets scared because of the overwhelming traffic. She then discovers a gym and gets the idea of going in and practice the hand signals you have to do as a cyclist in the Danish traffic.</p>
